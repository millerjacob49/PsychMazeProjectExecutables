Welcome to the MazeRunner experiment!
In today&#39;s experiment, you will attempt to learn the correct path through a virtual maze.
You will use the Xbox controller to control the movement of your point of view through
the maze, much like you would in a FPS (first-person shooter) video game.
The joystick under your left thumb controls movement, and the joystick under your right
thumb controls the direction of your gaze. Please let the RA know if you need help
understanding the controls.
On each trial, your task will be to find your way through the maze as fast as possible.
You will have 100 seconds to run through the maze.
If you don&#39;t find your way out during that time, you will be reset at the beginning of the
maze. It may look strange when you reset, but if you use the controller to move into the
maze, it will look familiar again.
You should pay attention on each run to the path you&#39;re taking, as it may help you learn
the maze over time.
When you&#39;re ready to begin, click &quot;Start&quot; on the screen.
